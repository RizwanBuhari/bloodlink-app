    # If firebase_options.dart is generated by FlutterFire and contains project-specific keys
    # and you expect each collaborator to configure their own Firebase project,
    # then you should ignore this too.
    # If firebase_options.dart is generic or you manage keys differently, you might commit it.
    # For initial setup where each user has their own Firebase, ignoring it is safer.
